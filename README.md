# EV-Dashboard
This dataset shows the Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) that are currently registered through Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL). BEV sales during Q2 2023 grew over 50% YoY. One in every 10 cars sold during Q2 2023 was a pure battery electric vehicle (BEV).
